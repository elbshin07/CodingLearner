## How to publish (quick)
1. Upload contents to any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
2. Point a custom domain (recommended) in host settings.
3. Add Google Search Console & verify ownership (optional).
4. Apply for Google AdSense after your site has enough original content and required pages.

## Monetization & AdSense (short checklist)
- You must be 18+ to apply for AdSense (or apply through a parent/guardian). See official Google help for eligibility. (source: Google Support)
- Site should have original, high-quality content and essential pages: About, Contact, Privacy Policy. (source: Google Support + guides)
- Owning a custom domain and having consistent content updates improves approval chances. Some regions/sites benefit from the domain being active for several months. (third-party guides)

IMPORTANT: Google policies and regional rules can change. Before applying, check the official AdSense Eligibility page: https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9724

## Next steps I can do for you (pick any)

- Add SEO meta tags and sitemap.xml.
- Insert AdSense placeholder code after you get approved.
